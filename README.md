# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
- Louise is a playwriter looking for crowdfunding for her play for an estimated $10k and need an analysis on crowdfunded plays to understand the driving factors behind the success/failure. 
## Analysis and Challenges
- Analysis was performed by creating some new columns that helped contextualize the data such as the percentage each campaign was funded and corresponding data as to whether that was a successful or failed one. 
- ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Most of the succesful theatre campaigns were launched in early spring and more specifically May(13%) followed by June(12%) and July(10%) and with the least success during the holidays, December (4%)
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Goals upwards of $45,000 were definitely set up for failure with a 100% of it failing (zero success) . The $0-$5000 with lower$ makes it easier to succeed and the range between $5-35,000 maintaining a 50-60% of success .
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Challenges were faced during the countif function when the thresholds limit missed a small slice of the data and I could not tie back to the total; such as 1000-4999 and then 5000 to 9999, The formulae needs to include =< or=> to ensure that all
all data ranges are picked up

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Spring is a good time to launch theatre. Winter is the least favorable time to launch. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Smaller budgets are more successful. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- It does not talk about the age category that contribute to the success of the play. Does not talk about the platform used to advertise
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Create category wise split of success to understand what categories and further subcategories are most successful. What the outcomes of staff picks looks like and if it drives the outcomes one way or the other.
